# Missing Accessdate Finder for Word XML Format

This tool searches for reference entries in a Word bibliography XML file without access dates.

Use `fixAccessDate (filename, outputFilename, year, month, day)` to add access timestamps to entries in your source XML file. The `<outputFilename>.xml` will contain fixed entries ready to be imported into Word.
